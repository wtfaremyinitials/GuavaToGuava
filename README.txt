Explanation: GuavasToGuavas is a pretty simple game. Each player has answer cards in their hands. A question card is then posed to the group of players. Each player chooses a card that they believe to be the funniest response to the question. One player is selected to be the Czar. They don't play an answer card and, instead, choose the best answer card from their fellow players. Whoever they choose wins that round. Each round, the czar is rotated, similar to a dealer chip in poker.
